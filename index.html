    Welcome! I'm Jordan Moore.
    <p>I am a Full-Stack Developer, operating out of the beautiful Hudson Valley in New York state.</p>
    <p>The languages I currently work with are <em>JavaScript</em> and <em>Ruby</em>. <strong>PostgreSQL</strong> is my database of choice, and my go-to frameworks are <em>Express</em> and <em>Sinatra</em>.</p>
    <p>My most recent completed project is <strong>DS-Plus</strong>, which is a <em>Node.js</em> package for implementing non-native data structures in <em>JavaScript</em>, like Graphs, Linked Lists, AVL Trees, and more.</p>
    <p>In the navigation bar, one will find a link to a page entitled <strong>Media</strong>. This page contains links to all of my articles, case studies, and instructional videos.</p>
